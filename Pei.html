                <h2>John F. Kennedy Library</h2>
                <p>Constructed in 1979, concrete and glass make up this geometric structure, which sits on ten acres of park in Dorchester’s Columbia Point. As JFK’s presidential museum and library, the distinctive building houses abundant archival materials from Kennedy’s time in the White House, as well as an extensive collection of original Ernest Hemingway manuscript materials, donated by his wife Mary Walsh Hemingway.</p>

                <p>As Boston’s most comprehensive art museum, and one of the largest in the country, the MFA is at the top of any tourist’s list. Wander through the large atrium into the western side of the institution to find the West Wing, now called the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art, an architectural masterpiece in a sea of art. Completed in 1981, the extension showcases contemporary art throughout seven galleries, carrying Pei’s innovative legacy forward.</p>

                <h2>Government Center Urban Renewal Plan</h2>
                <p>If you’ve ever ice skated in, power-walked through, or paused to enjoy the sun in City Hall Plaza, you’ve experienced a piece of Pei history. In the 1960s, I.M Pei & Associates was responsible for rethinking the whole of what is now Government Center, while the central plaza—then paved with brick—was Pei’s brainchild. Though the space has since been redesigned, the site of Boston’s brutalist nerve center still harkens back to Pei.</p>

                <h2>The Green Building at MIT</h2>
                <p>Cambridge’s second tallest building (after another MIT construction) was also built according to Pei’s plans. Home to the university’s departments of atmospheric, planetary, and geo sciences, the 21-story building is impressive in stature and scientific significance. The many-windowed academic building was completed in 1964, more than two decades after Pei received his own Bachelor’s degree from the prestigious university. The architect also designed a series of other buildings for the university’s Cambridge campus, including the long and low modernist Dreyfus Building, which houses the Department of Chemistry. A 2003 renovation sought to bring more light to the inner laboratories, but the structure still stands as a testament to Pei. MIT-goers can also glimpse his thinking in the Weisner Building, home to the arts and media center, and the aerodynamic Ralph Landau Building for chemical engineering.</p>

                <h2>The Wiesner Building at MIT</h2>
                <p>The Wiesner building was Pei's fourth major contributor to the MIT campus, and was built to host the newly created MIT Media Lab in 1985. Pei notes the unusual collaborative effort as an architect working with three artists: Kenneth Noland created the panels and colored bars on the outside and in the atrium, Scott Burton designed the public seating, the stairwell and the balustrades, and Richard Fleischner designed the space between the building and its neighbors. The building currently houses the MIT Media Lab, the Center for Bits and Atoms (Neil Gershenfeld's lab), the Department of Architecture's Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT, formerly the Visual Arts Program), the Comparative Media Studies/Writing (CMS/W) program and the List Visual Arts Center.</p>

                <h2>John Hancock Tower</h2>
                <p>John Hancock Tower and colloquially known as The Hancock, is a 60-story, 790-foot (240 m) skyscraper in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. It is the tallest building in New England. The tower was designed by Henry N. Cobb of the firm I. M. Pei & Partners and was completed in 1976. The building is widely known for its prominent structural flaws, including an analysis that the entire building could overturn under certain wind loads—as well as a prominent design failure of its signature blue windows, which allowed any of the 500-lb. window panes to detach and fall—up to the full height of the building—endangering pedestrians below.</p>

                <h2>I.M. Pei’s Buildings in Boston</h2>
                <p id="IMPeiText">The Chinese-American architect I.M. (Ieoh Ming) Pei is widely regarded as the most important living modern architect. However, many do not know that Mr. Pei immigrated to the United States through Angel Island as a young student from Shanghai in 1935. He was admitted on August 28, 1935, when he was just 18 years old, on his way to the University of Pennsylvania where he had been accepted to study architecture. In contrast to many Angel Island immigrant stories of isolation and despair, Pei’s memory of his arrival at Angel Island is one of joy and excitement. The fact that the young Pei was carrying an official student visa issued by the American Consulate-General in Shanghai probably explains this happier memory as he was unlikely to have had problems with immigration when he landed. Students with a visa were amongst the few exceptions to the exclusion of most Asians under the Immigration Act of 1924.<br><br>Upon landing in San Francisco, Pei continued his travel to the University of Pennsylvania where he planned to study architecture. However, he spent just a few weeks at Penn, transferring shortly thereafter to MIT which had a program that more closely matched his interests. He graduated from MIT with a degree in architecture in 1940. He then became a teaching fellow in the School of Design at Harvard University.<br><br>Having studied and worked in Boston, his legacy lines many of the Boston streets.
